libandfill is a library providing general purpose functionality such as
error tracing, output abstraction and similar stuff.

Functions provided by libandfill are implemented in a thread-safe way. In
the first place, this means that all functions are reentrant. Furthermore,
functions that access shared resources (such as files, terminals, etc.) try
to make use of thread-level locking mechanisms (e. g. pthread mutexes).

libandfill is developed and tested on GNU/Linux and FreeBSD. There is some
likeliness it will also work on other POSIX compliant operating systems;
however there is no guarantee it will do so.
